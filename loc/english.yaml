ygr_fuel_03: "And the backroom is locked, of course. Maybe you should try to find out something about the guy in there, see if we could lure him out of there."
ygr_fuel_04: "Well, at least we now know the name of the asshole inside the backroom. Find me his number so we can 'coax' him to open the door. I think Alvarez had some issues with the guy before, maybe you can find things to cross-reference, like a book of records perhaps?"
ygr_fuel_05: "Okay, I think I have an idea. Alvarez told me once that the pumps keep record of who used it, helps sniff out any cheapskates looking to get gassed up for free, yeah? Maybe you could find something to cross-reference with, try and eavesdrop on the mobsters for the name of the guy if you haven't already, then cross-reference it with a book of records perhaps?"
ygr_fuel_06_01: "We need Carl's number, it should be here somewhere."
