heist_fuel_briefing: "On the outside, the gas station Alvarez runs looks like any other. However, only a few know what actually lies underneath. He has been using the basement for months now, operating as a money launderer, cocaine dealer and gasoline kingpin. He's had issues with the mob for a while now, but the sudden takeover came as a surprise, …diese Hunde.\nWell, here are the simple objectives: Find a way into the basement, locate and free Alvarez, and escape. I don't have info on how the situation has unfolded there, so we have to go in blind. Either guns blazing or silently, I don't care, just make sure you get him out alive and in one piece, verstanden?"

# - SUBTITLES

ygr_fuel_01: "Alright, you're here. Before we do anything, we need to check around the gas station, see how we could get in there."
ygr_fuel_02: "Alright, the mole has agreed to meet you behind the mechanic workshop. Go there and talk to him."
ygr_fuel_03: "And the backroom is locked, of course. Maybe you should try to find out something about the guy in there, see if we could lure him out of there."
ygr_fuel_04: "Well, at least we now know the name of the asshole inside the backroom. Find me his number so we can 'coax' him to open the door. I think Alvarez had some issues with the guy before, maybe you can find things to cross-reference, like a book of records perhaps?"
ygr_fuel_05: "Okay, I think I have an idea. Alvarez told me once that the pumps keep record of who used it, helps sniff out any cheapskates looking to get gassed up for free, yeah? Maybe you could find something to cross-reference with, try and eavesdrop on the mobsters for the name of the guy if you haven't already, then cross-reference it with a book of records perhaps?"
ygr_fuel_06_01: "We need Carl's number, it should be here somewhere."
ygr_fuel_06_02: "Remember, we're looking for the number of a 'Daniel'."
ygr_fuel_06_03: "Guys, the number of a 'Barry', go find it."
ygr_fuel_06_04: "Remember, Henry's the number to look for."
ygr_fuel_06_05: "Once again, find what Erwan's number is."
ygr_fuel_06_06: "Right, You need to find out Tommy's number."
ygr_fuel_06_07: "You better find and call Mike's number."
ygr_fuel_08: "Hahahah, sucker caught the hook, line, and the sinker. Quick, find somewhere to hide when he storms out of there."
ygr_fuel_09: "Phew, look at him go... He's not going to be back for a long while. Come on, hurry into the backroom, we've still got to rescue Alvarez!"
ygr_fuel_10: "Scheiße! That was the wrong number, a civilian called the cops on us, they're on their way now!"
ygr_fuel_11: "Interesting, he decided to set up the security room here, bit of a security flaw but works in our favour, try finding Alvarez via the cameras, or look for the room in the basement yourself."
ygr_fuel_12: "Christ, he's getting beat up badly, so we have to act fast. Okay, I have an idea, you see that box of pizza in the camera room? How about we 'spice' it up a bit with some cleaning product and lure them out, ja? We'll also need to loop the footage of the cameras in the room, so find a hard drive, there should be one stored somewhere."
ygr_fuel_13: "Still haven't found them yet? The hard drive should be stored in a secure location, check the lockers."
ygr_fuel_14: "Still haven't found the items yet? The cleaning product should be on somewhere obvious, perhaps a shelf?"
ygr_fuel_15: "Found the items? Wunderbar. First thing's first, set up the hard drive on the desk, we need to record then loop the cameras in the room Alvarez is held in so as to not raise suspicion for who else might look into the cameras."
ygr_fuel_16: "Okay, footage should be good enough. Now, let's add our special condiment into the pizza and finish the delivery, shall we?"
ygr_fuel_17: "Before you deliver the pizza, take the hard drive with you, you need to find a circuit box in the basement and set it up there, that should loop the camera feed in the room."
ygr_fuel_18: "Special pizza delivery! Place the pizza in front of the shutter and give it a few knocks to let them know that food is served."
ygr_fuel_19: "Delivery complete! Quickly Freunde, gather at the back of the room, you could take that ventilation duct as a shortcut. You don't wanna miss this show."
ygr_fuel_20: "What are you doing? Hurry up and gather up behind the room, don't want to get spotted or miss our chance this far in now."
ygr_fuel_21: "Perfekt, it worked! Now, go free Alvarez, the room is cleared, I also managed to get the doors open."
ygr_fuel_22: "Al! Glad to see you're in one piece. I am not sure about the blood though, I don't think that's the kind of fashion choice you'd fit in."
ygr_fuel_23: "Ha, poetic, using the same entry they used to infiltrate their base of operations."
ygr_fuel_24: "You heard the man, go find and rescue the hostages."
ygr_fuel_25: "Having trouble finding the hostages? That one employee said they are likely being held around the rooms of the building, but check every nook and cranny just to be safe."
ygr_fuel_26: "That should be all of them, nice work! Now rendezvous with Alvarez on the top floor, and let's show that bastard what happens when you mess with my friends…"
ygr_fuel_27: "Freunde, we could worry about looting the place later, but first, you need to meet up with Alvarez."
ygr_fuel_28: "There he is! Kill him before he turns around!"
ygr_fuel_29: "Good! That, my friend, is why you never mess with any of my contacts."
ygr_fuel_30: "Whatever is in his safe should give us a clue as to why he did this."
ygr_fuel_31: "Scheiße, I had a feeling that the Jackals were behind all of this. They paid Victor to lure me out, but he sure wasn't the brightest at approaching it."
ygr_fuel_32: "Oh shush, at least we got you out before you faced any crippling damage."
ygr_fuel_33: "You know me, I always look after my friends, Al."
ygr_fuel_34: "Acknowledged. You guys could leave now, we've done our part here. However, if you still have some things you need to do, make sure you don't alert anyone. Cops will be on the way, and you'd have a short window of time to leave before things go loud."
ygr_fuel_35: Scheiße, what happened! Police chatter is heating up, you've got about one minute to get out of there before they start their first assault and close the perimeter, roadblocks are going to make our bikes useless!
ygr_fuel_36: "Found some of Alvarez's product? Wunderbar, I am sending a pickup truck to the side alley next to the café, that's where you could secure the loot, I'm sure he'll appreciate it."
ygr_fuel_37: "Found some of Alvarez's product? Wunderbar, there's a garbage truck parked outside around the pumps. As long as things stay silent, we could use it to secure some product. I'm sure he'll appreciate it."

ygr_fuel_38: "Guns blazing it is then! Take out all the mob goons first before we proceed with the plan."
ygr_fuel_39: "Damnit, Fucker locked himself into the backroom. Put a codebreaker onto the keypad, we're forcing our way in!"
ygr_fuel_40: "The hatch to the basement is shut tightly. Alvarez was always big on security. Check the mechanic shop for something to force the hatch open."
ygr_fuel_41: "A car winch? Perfekt! We'll just D.I.Y. us a makeshift winch to tear the hatch open. Let's see here…"
ygr_fuel_42: "Take that winch to the backroom, then grab the jumper cables and fetch a battery from the store shelf. That'll supply the winch for long enough."
ygr_fuel_43: "Still haven't found the battery yet? Look around the shelves of the store, they should have some being sold there."
ygr_fuel_44: "Get that winch to the hatch, then find a generator and some cans of diesel around the gas station. Surely this will power through the hatch quickly."
ygr_fuel_45: "Still haven't found it yet? The generator should be either around the workshop or sold on the shelves of the store."
ygr_fuel_46: "That table should do the job. Just clean it of any obstructing objects and we're good to go."
ygr_fuel_47: "Yes, it's working! Now just protect the winch and we'll be through that hatch in no time!"
ygr_fuel_48: "The generator stopped working, Freunde. Go fetch a new can of diesel so it keeps going."
ygr_fuel_49: "The diesel should be stored in green cans, scattered around the place. Try finding them in random places where you could stack it up a wall or lay down somewhere."
ygr_fuel_50: "The winch has jammed, go get some spare parts!"
ygr_fuel_51: "Check the mechanic workshop, chances are you'll find tools or spare parts there."
ygr_fuel_52: "Still haven't got the spare parts? Look for them in the workshop, they should be in one of those large toolboxes."
ygr_fuel_53: "Winch is working again. Let's keep it that way!"
ygr_fuel_54: "Hahaha, yes! The hatch has been torn wide open. Now get down there and find Alvarez!"
ygr_fuel_55: "Scheiße, did these assholes really trap him inside the freezer? We gotta breach that door open quickly! Naomi, can you deliver a door breacher to the gas station?"
ygr_fuel_56: "You heard Naomi, I heard Alvarez was selling fireworks here, so there must be a box around. Find it!"
ygr_fuel_57: "Alright, the breacher is here. Now open the freezer door before Alvarez freezes to death!"
ygr_fuel_58: "What's taking you so long!? Alvarez is going to die in there any second now, get the door open NOW!"
ygr_fuel_59: "Scheiße, they really fucked him up."
ygr_fuel_60: "Good to see you're still in one piece, Alvarez."
ygr_fuel_61a: "So, Al, what did these guys want from you anyway?"
ygr_fuel_62a: "I don't even know these punks, but if your guess is correct, it seems they know a lot about me and the contacts I have, we have to get to the bottom of this."
ygr_fuel_61b: "How are your injuries, Alvarez?"
ygr_fuel_62b: "Are you sure you want to do this in your condition?"
ygr_fuel_63b: "Fine, but we will get you a doc once this has concluded."
ygr_fuel_61c: "Oh, they've been helping me go against some old friends, y'know. When they sent the video with the ransom request, it was obvious that it was a trap. Going commando all by myself would've been suicide."
ygr_fuel_62c: "Ha, wait until you really see them in action, then you'll see what they are made of."
ygr_fuel_61d: "How long is it going to take?"
ygr_fuel_62d: "I see.. Don't worry, Al, we'll get you back on track. I'll see to getting you in contact with Crime.net, you should be able to get your connections back from there."
ygr_fuel_64: "Does that mean we can leave now?"
ygr_fuel_65: "Right, we'll be sure to get them out of there, what's your plan?"
ygr_fuel_66: "Huh? That body armour looks familiar... look, a key fell out of his pocket."
ygr_fuel_67: "That safe's rigged with C4, take cover!"
ygr_fuel_68: "You know we have bikes, right? You can just take those and leave."
ygr_fuel_69: "Fine, you're right. Those bikes were stolen pieces of junk anyway."
ygr_fuel_70: "Ugh... of course it does."
ygr_fuel_71: "Ja, ja. You heard him. Push the car towards the pumps."
ygr_fuel_72: "Alright, the car is in position. Now connect the pump to the car and let it refuel."
ygr_fuel_73: "You heard him. Either detach the hose and leave now, or go and secure more loot if you feel like it."

ton_fuel_02_01: "I heard them call him Carl."
ton_fuel_02_02: "I saw him here once, think he's named Daniel."
ton_fuel_02_03: "I believe he's called Barry."
ton_fuel_02_04: "I think the guy is called Henry."
ton_fuel_02_05: "The name of the guy's Erwan from what I heard."
ton_fuel_02_06: "I eavesdropped on the thugs calling him Tommy."
ton_fuel_02_07: "I believe his name was Mike."

nao_fuel_01: "I am on my way, but this weather makes it hard to see. Can you light something to mark the drop zone?"
nao_fuel_02: "The weather isn't getting any better soon, so I would really appreciate those fireworks guys."
nao_fuel_03: "Alright, I'm seeing the light show. I'll be there in 30 seconds."
nao_fuel_04: "Approaching the drop zone now, get ready to collect the breacher!"
nao_fuel_05: "Whoo, did you guys see that? Right through the manhole! Package delivered."

alz_fuel_01: "I expected some cavalry, but I wouldn't have expected the PAYDAY gang of all people to be here. Thanks for the earpiece, I think I know who sent you."
alz_fuel_02: "I see you still have your sense of humour, Freunde. Alright, let's go."
alz_fuel_03: "Fine work with the guards. Subtle, yet efficient."
alz_fuel_04: "Not yet, I still have some business to settle. Victor, the boss of the mob who raided my operation, has taken some of my employees hostage. I need your help rescuing my employees, and taking Victor out."
alz_fuel_05: "This is the entryway they used to enter the place, so we should be able to sneak in through here."
alz_fuel_06: "Shh, I'll take this one... Oi, Lucy!"
alz_fuel_07: "Now that was a waste of bullets, ahem."
alz_fuel_08: "Hey, are you alright?"
alz_fuel_09: "Understood. Would you mind backing up and erasing the contents of our terminal?"
alz_fuel_10: "Here's the plan, I am going to sneak my way up to Victor's personal office, while you will handle rescuing any remaining employees being held hostage here. Rendezvous at the top of the building. We are going to settle this ordeal..."
alz_fuel_11: "Freed my employees already? Good, I am almost done with lockpicking the door. When it opens, act fast."
alz_fuel_12: "And that concludes our agreement, Victor..."
alz_fuel_13: "Huh, it seems he's carrying a keychain, probably for his safe. Let's find it."
alz_fuel_14: "So it is thanks to you that I got my kneecaps smashed and face rearranged? Cheers to that."
alz_fuel_15: "Just messing with you, Yaeger! I am grateful for what you've done for me here."
alz_fuel_16: "Anyways, now that Victor has been swiftly dispatched, the remaining mobsters are going to be uncoordinated, and it would take them a while before they notice their leader's absence. My employees and I are going to dispose of them before they realise what's going on, so we'll take it from here, Yaeger."
alz_fuel_17: "Oh, one more thing. You've likely seen all the valuables around the area, if you want to stay here for a bit, feel free to take any that you find, I'll be sure to fence the goods and compensate you for them."
alz_fuel_18: "Christ, and it was going well too! I'll inform my men to cut the losses and get out of here, while I'll come with you."
alz_fuel_19: "Great! Now the bikes are merely deadweight. Right, follow me, I've got a car at the garage just for situations like this. One problem though, they've stolen the keys to the shutters, so you'll need to find a saw to open them up; look for one on the shelves at the gas station."
alz_fuel_21: "I expected some cavalry, but not the PAYDAY Gang of all people. *cough* Mind getting me some adrenaline? There's a first aid cabinet somewhere in the basement, it should be a white box with a green cross."
alz_fuel_22: "Much better, thank you. Hm? An earpiece? Right, I think I know who sent you..."
alz_fuel_23: "Had a knack it was you who sent them, Yaeger, thanks for the assistance. Before we continue, I need to wipe the data from this terminal first, it's got all the records regarding my operations, which the feds would *definitely* have a field day with if I don't. Cover me while I do."
alz_fuel_25a: "Given our history as competitors next to each other, it wasn't any surprise he wanted to do this eventually. However, Victor isn't that type to do this unless he had new hardware, and funding from someone with considerable power. Also, from what I heard after eavesdropping on one of them, they're also doing this to draw you out, so whoever this anonymous benefactor is, must have a vendetta against you."
alz_fuel_25b: "Other than some broken bones and the open wound I have? I'll manage, but before we do anything about that, I first need to get to the bottom of this."
alz_fuel_26b: "Like I said, I'll manage."
alz_fuel_25c: "Hey, how did you manage to get the PAYDAY gang to help you with this, Yaeger?"
alz_fuel_26c: "I see. I've got to say, I sure like the way they work."
alz_fuel_25d: "It's going to take a few minutes for me to fully delete everything. Preferably, I would've backed up the various contacts, records, and information stored here, but since we've been compromised, I can't afford to waste more time? There goes years of information."
alz_fuel_27_01: "Don't shoot!"
alz_fuel_27_02: "Alright, you've got me red handed."
alz_fuel_27_03: "You don't need to do this, officer."
alz_fuel_28: "Right, that should be good enough."
alz_fuel_29: "Like I said, we need to get to the bottom of this. Victor should have records in his office, that we could use to find out whoever's really behind this, and besides, I heard that my employees are being kept there."
alz_fuel_30: "Let me check the cages first, see if I can find something with a bit more bang... You get me?"
alz_fuel_31: "Now that's what I'm talking about! Okay, meet me at the parking lot. Let's head up, and 'kindly' ask them to let us in, so we can resolve our differences in a, diplomatic manner."
alz_fuel_32: "Knock knock, Victor! Open up if you're still up for a brief negotiation!"
alz_fuel_33: "There's your answer! Let's move in, fellas!"
alz_fuel_34: "Right, Victor has also taken my employees hostage, but I don't know the exact location of where they are held. The east wing is closed off, so the mob must be holding them somewhere either in the main building, or the west wing. I would appreciate it if you freed them, before we move on to our main attraction, hm?"
alz_fuel_35: "Judging from the layout of the building, Victor likely has my employees held inside the locked rooms, it's what he would do if he wants to spread them out in defendable positions. He also breached into my basement of operations from a room adjacent to it, so it might be worth looking around there as well."
alz_fuel_36: "That's all of them freed, thank you. Time to move on to Victor, and finish this"
alz_fuel_37: "What are you waiting for? Hurry up and gather around, before Victor weasels his way out!"
alz_fuel_38: "It's showtime!"
alz_fuel_39: "See that, Victor? The negotiations were short after all."
alz_fuel_40: "Hm? Must be for his safe. Let's see if he has any info stashed up."
alz_fuel_41: "Whatever, we can talk about that later. Let's get out of here. I have a car in the garage, but you'll need to saw the shutters open, since they stole my keys. There should be a saw on the tool shelves at the gas station."
alz_fuel_42: "I thought you knew better, Yaeger! A bike might be more maneuverable, sure, but I am not looking forward to getting shot off it. My car should be able to smash through roadblocks *just* fine!"
alz_fuel_43: "Wrong door, fellas. I'll go start the engine ahead of time though."
alz_fuel_44: "Excellent! Let's get this bad boy started then, shall we?"
alz_fuel_45: "Alright, uhm... got a slight problem, turns out the tank is empty, so the car needs to be refuelled."
alz_fuel_46: "This bad boy doesn't run on diesel, but how convenient is it that we're at a gas station, eh?"
alz_fuel_47: "Excuse me, fellas, but I can't start the car up without getting it fueled up first, so I would appreciate it if you push the car towards the pumps, thanks."
alz_fuel_48: "Oh, right, the bollards. The back room has a box with the switch. Flip it to lower them."
alz_fuel_49: "By the way, you might've seen all the valuables around the area. Why not throw anything you find into the trunk of the car while it refuels. I'll put some extra on top for everything you retrieve."
alz_fuel_50: "Alright, the tank is full! Ready to go when you are, just get the hose off and we'll be speeding out of here!"
